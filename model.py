    in the same entity group, so transactions can be easily used both
    for updating (moving tasks etc) and traversing the data. As tasks
    are all linked through references, a transaction must be used to
    get a consistent view on the data traversing through the
    hierarchy/graph. Using an entity group in this way does limit the
    writes to about 1/sec across the entire system, but in practice
    that should not pose a problem as the application is read
    dominated.

    Tasks do not have a specific keyname, but use the auto-generated
    numeric ids.

    Some properties are replicated in the TaskIndex model. Each
    Task has a corresponding TaskIndex, which is used to perform
    some queries.

    calls, and can be used freely. Avoid accessing the properties
